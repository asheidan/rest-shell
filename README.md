# REST-shell

Have you ever searched in your history for that particular curl-command or
tried to use curl to explore a rest-ful service?
Then this is probably for you.

This is a stupid wrapper for curl which emulates a really stupid ftp-client.
It does have support for setting Accept-header and basic authentication.

Please leave a bug-report and/or feature-request on [Github][gh] if you use
this but find something amiss.
